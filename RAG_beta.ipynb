    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using abstracts from the [arXiv preprint server](https://arxiv.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "We:\n",
    "- Fetch recent abstracts from arXiv\n",
    "- Embed them using a transformer-based sentence encoder\n",
    "- Store and retrieve embeddings using FAISS\n",
    "- Use GPT to generate answers from retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "##  FAISS: Facebook AI Similarity Search\n",
    "\n",
    "FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) is a high-performance library for **efficient similarity search** over dense vector representations. It is especially well-suited for applications like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), recommendation systems, and nearest-neighbor search in embedding spaces.  \n",
    "\n",
    "###  How It Works:\n",
    "- FAISS stores all of our abstract embeddings as vectors in a **vector index**.\n",
    "- When a user enters a query, we embed it using the same model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).\n",
    "- FAISS compares the query vector to the stored vectors and returns the **top-k most similar** entries based on distance (usually L2 or cosine).\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why We Use FAISS:\n",
    "- **Speed**: Handles millions of vectors efficiently with GPU/CPU support.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Works well for large-scale document search.\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: Easy to use for exact or approximate nearest neighbor search.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  In This Project:\n",
    "- We use `IndexFlatL2` (a brute-force exact search index using Euclidean distance).\n",
    "- Abstracts are embedded once and stored.\n",
    "- At query time, FAISS retrieves the most semantically similar papers in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to build a fast and responsive retrieval system that scales with more data.  Please visit [their gitub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/) for more info.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Model Overview: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from the [SentenceTransformers](https://www.sbert.net/) library to convert text into dense vector embeddings. These embeddings represent the **semantic meaning** of text and are used for similarity search in our RAG system.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Key Features:\n",
    "- **Architecture**: MiniLM (6 Transformer layers, distilled from BERT)\n",
    "- **Embedding Dimension**: 384\n",
    "- **Speed**: Extremely fast, making it suitable for real-time or large-scale applications\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Optimized for general-purpose semantic similarity tasks (e.g., question answering, duplicate detection, clustering)\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Why We Use It:\n",
    "- Lightweight and fast — ideal for prototyping and scalable applications\n",
    "- High-quality embeddings despite small size\n",
    "- Pretrained on a diverse set of tasks like Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Output:\n",
    "Each input text (e.g., an arXiv abstract or a user query) is mapped to a 384-dimensional vector that can be compared to other vectors using cosine or Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is especially useful for identifying semantically similar scientific texts, even when exact keywords don’t match.\n"

       "\n",
       "Recent research on the Higgs boson has been exploring various extensions and modifications of the Standard Model (SM) to understand its properties and interactions better. Here are some key developments:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Resonant Higgs Pair Production**: Researchers are investigating the production of Higgs boson pairs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the context of the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). This involves studying the effects of new neutral Higgs states and colored scalars, such as stops or sbottoms, which can significantly alter the expected signals. These studies aim to identify potential new physics scenarios by analyzing the interference effects between resonant and non-resonant processes (Paper 1).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Trilinear Higgs Self-Couplings**: Another area of focus is the loop-corrected trilinear Higgs self-couplings in the NMSSM with an Inverse Seesaw Mechanism. This research highlights the importance of higher-order corrections to the Higgs boson mass and self-couplings, which are crucial for precise theoretical predictions. The study finds that new effects from extended neutrino and sneutrino sectors can lead to significant corrections, impacting both the trilinear couplings and the Higgs boson mass (Paper 2).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **New Scalar Particles**: There is also interest in new scalar particles associated with additional gauge symmetries, such as a quark-universal $U(1)$ symmetry. These scalars, which may mix with the SM Higgs boson, could be produced at the LHC and decay into Standard Model particles. Such scenarios could lead to observable phenomena like diphoton resonances, providing potential new avenues for discovering physics beyond the Standard Model (Paper 3).\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, these studies reflect a vibrant area of research focused on understanding the Higgs boson's role in the broader context of particle physics and exploring potential new physics that could emerge from its interactions."

       "The research papers you provided discuss various aspects of the Higgs boson, particularly within the context of extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics, such as the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM). Here's a summary of the key points related to the Higgs boson from these papers:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Trilinear Higgs Self-Couplings and Mass Corrections (Paper 2)**:\n",
       "   - The paper by Thi Nhung Dao et al. focuses on the NMSSM with an Inverse Seesaw Mechanism. It examines higher-order corrections to the SM-like Higgs boson mass and the trilinear Higgs self-couplings.\n",
       "   - The study finds that these corrections are significant and highly correlated, with new effects from the extended neutrino and sneutrino sectors.\n",
       "   - The corrections can lead to changes of up to 10% in the effective SM-like trilinear Higgs self-couplings and up to 4.5% in the SM-like Higgs boson mass.\n",
       "   - These findings are important for understanding the Higgs boson's properties and potential deviations from the Standard Model predictions.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Resonant Higgs Pair Production (Paper 3)**:\n",
       "   - The paper by Stefano Moretti et al. investigates the resonant production of Higgs boson pairs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within the NMSSM framework.\n",
       "   - It explores the effects of new neutral Higgs states and colored scalars (stops or sbottoms) in loops, which can interfere with resonant Higgs production.\n",
       "   - These interferences can significantly alter the expected signal, potentially masking or revealing new physics scenarios.\n",
       "   - The study provides benchmark points that could exhibit observable features in di-Higgs decay channels during current or future LHC runs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, these papers highlight ongoing research efforts to understand the Higgs boson's properties and interactions, particularly in scenarios beyond the Standard Model. They explore how new physics, such as additional particles and interactions in the NMSSM, could affect Higgs boson measurements and potentially reveal new insights into fundamental physics."

       "\n",
       "1. **Composite Higgs Models**: In Paper 1, a composite Higgs model is discussed where the Higgs boson is realized as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson. This model aims to explain the flavor hierarchies between different families of particles through an extended non-universal gauge symmetry. The model predicts specific patterns in the CKM and PMNS matrices, which are important for understanding particle mixing and flavor physics.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Charged Higgs Bosons**: Paper 2 explores the potential for discovering charged Higgs bosons at the International Linear Collider (ILC) within the framework of the type-X Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM). The study focuses on the production processes and decay channels of these charged Higgs bosons, particularly in scenarios where they have masses around 200 GeV. The research highlights the potential for observing these particles through specific decay signatures, which could provide insights into Higgs mixing parameters.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Trilinear Higgs Self-Couplings**: Paper 3 investigates the higher-order corrections to the trilinear Higgs self-couplings in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) with an Inverse Seesaw Mechanism. The study emphasizes the importance of loop corrections and their impact on the Higgs boson mass and self-couplings. The research also considers the effects of extended neutrino and sneutrino sectors, which can lead to significant corrections in the Higgs sector.\n",
